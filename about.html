                <h2>Meet Our Founder</h2>
                <p>
                    Pet Store was founded by a passionate animal lover who wanted to create a place where pet owners
                    could find reliable, high-quality products in one convenient location. Growing up surrounded by
                    pets,
                    our founder developed a deep understanding of the joy and responsibility that comes with caring for
                    animals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a vision to support both pets and their owners, the founder established Pet Store to focus on
                    quality, trust, and customer satisfaction. Today, the store continues to grow while staying true to
                    its original mission — helping pets live happier and healthier lives.
